{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'zip()' function in Python?", "answer": "The 'zip()' function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (such as lists) into tuples of corresponding elements. It returns an iterator of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is a decorator in Python?", "answer": "A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as input and extends its behavior without modifying its code. It is commonly used to add functionality such as logging, caching, or authentication to functions."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'staticmethod' decorator in Python?", "answer": "The 'staticmethod' decorator in Python is used to define a static method inside a class. Static methods do not have access to the instance or class state and are typically used for utility functions that do not depend on instance or class state."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'classmethod' decorator in Python?", "answer": "The 'classmethod' decorator in Python is used to define a class method inside a class. Class methods have access to the class itself and can be used to modify class-level variables or perform operations related to the class."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'property' decorator in Python?", "answer": "The 'property' decorator in Python is used to define properties (attributes) on a class that behave like normal attributes but have custom getter, setter, and deleter methods. It allows you to encapsulate attribute access and modification."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'super()' function in Python?", "answer": "The 'super()' function in Python is used to call methods of a superclass from within a subclass. It allows you to invoke superclass methods without explicitly naming the superclass, enabling easier maintenance of inheritance hierarchies."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is a context manager in Python?", "answer": "A context manager in Python is an object that defines the runtime context for a block of code. It enables you to perform setup and cleanup actions automatically before and after executing the block of code, using the 'with' statement."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'with' statement in Python?", "answer": "The 'with' statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within a context manager. It ensures that the context manager's setup and cleanup actions are performed correctly, even if an exception occurs within the block."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'collections' module in Python?", "answer": "The 'collections' module in Python provides specialized container datatypes that extend the capabilities of built-in data types such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. It includes classes like 'Counter', 'defaultdict', 'OrderedDict', and 'deque'."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'itertools' module in Python?", "answer": "The 'itertools' module in Python provides functions for creating iterators for efficient looping over sequences and combining sequences. It includes functions like 'chain()', 'cycle()', 'repeat()', 'count()', and 'zip_longest()'."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 're' module in Python?", "answer": "The 're' module in Python provides support for regular expressions (regex). It allows you to search, match, and manipulate strings using patterns defined with regular expression syntax."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'os' module in Python?", "answer": "The 'os' module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to perform tasks such as file and directory manipulation, process management, and environment variable access."}
{"job_title": "Python Developer", "question": "What is the purpose of the 'sys' module in Python?", "answer": "The 'sys' module in Python provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. It allows you to interact with the Python interpreter, access command-line arguments, and manipulate the Python runtime environment."}
