questions,answers
What is Go?,"Go is also known as GoLang, it is a general-purpose programming language designed at Google and developed by Robert Griesemer, ken Thomson and Rob Pike. It is a statistically typed programming language used for building fast and reliable applications."
What are the key features of the Go language?,"Go is the short form of Golang. It is an open-source as well as general-purpose programming language. Go is an easy-to-learn language with a built-in concurrency and standard library. It is also a statistically-typed language that helps to build reliable applications. It is the best language that we can use to develop scalable web applications, network services, and command-line tools."
What do you mean by dynamic type variable declaration in Golang?,The compiler needs to interpret the variable type in the dynamic variable declaration. It is usually done based on the value passed to the compiler.
What are packages in Golang?,"Go programs are usually organized into packages. A package is nothing but a collection of source files in the same directory. These files are compiled together. The main thing is that variables, functions, and constants are stored in one source file. The files are visible to other files in the same package.Go programs start with the main package. We can use the import commands for importing the ‘math/rand’ and ‘fmt’ packages."
What do you mean by static type variable declaration in Golang?,This declaration ensures the compiler that there is only one variable with the given type and name. This approach allows the compiler to continue the compilation without needing variable details.
What are the two crucial operators used in Golang?,"'*' and '&' operators are used in Golang. '*' is the dereferencing operator that we use to declare a pointer. Also, we use this operator to access the value stored at the address. When it comes to the '&' operator, it is known as the address operator, and we use this operator to get the address of a variable."
What short notes on constants in Go?,"In the Go programming, constants are declared with the const keyword. A constant can be a character, Boolean, string, or numeric value. Numeric constant is the type of constant that is an untyped constant. Besides, it consists of high-precision values."
State about pointers in Go.,"Pointers represent the addresses of objects stored in the memory. They are typically variables. More to the point, pointers are known as special variables in Golang. Pointers can have different data types like ‘int' and 'string'. Note that the memory addresses typically are stored in pointers in hexadecimal formats."
What are the data types of Golang?,"Know that there are four data types in Golang.
Integer data type – it is used to declare integer numbers
Float data type – It is used to declare decimal numbers
String data type – it is a sequence of characters
Boolean data type – it has either true or false value."
What do you understand by Golang variable scope?,"Golang variable scope is nothing but a part of the code. This is where you can access and modify specified variables. There are two categories of scope variables: local variables and global variables. Local variables are usually declared inside a function or block of a code, whereas global variables are declared outside of a function or block of a code.    "
Describe methods in Golang.,A Golang method is a function but has a special receiver argument. Golang methods are typically similar to go functions. Golang methods have receiver arguments. The method can receive the receiver's properties using the receiver argument. Note that the receiver can be either struct type or non-struct type.
Is Go language case-sensitive?,Yes. Golang is a case-sensitive language.
Mention the three directories of the Golang workspace.,"Golang workspace is usually a directory hierarchy of Go programs. A workspace consists of three subdirectories, as mentioned below.
src – This directory includes the source files as packages.
pkg – Go package objects are stored in this directory
Bin – This directory includes the executable programs."
List out the advantages of Golang.,"Following are the key advantages of Golang.
Quick and simple coding
Golang comes with a garbage collector
Go compilation is quicker
It provides increased availability and reliability
It can be employed for large-scale projects
It works well with multi-core processors
It provides powerful performance
The learning curve is low for Golang
Golang supports concurrency"
Why is Golang so popular?,"Here are the reasons why Golang is so popular.
It is an interpreted and statically typed language
It supports cross-platform application development
It compiles codes with speed
Its syntax is compact and simple"
What is the use of the ‘init’ function Golang?,The ‘init’ function is usually called at the beginning of the execution time. We use the ‘init’ method to add initialization logic into the package.
What are the decision-making statements of Golang?,"Below are the different decision-making statements of Golang
If statement – It is a simple decision-making statement
If…else statement -  If the given condition is true, it will run a set of codes. Otherwise, it will run another set of codes.
Nested if statement - It is the statement where an if statement consists of another if statement inside of it.
If…else…if ladder – This if statement is used when there are many conditions. When no condition is satisfied, then the final ‘else’ statement will be executed.’"
What is the role of a slice in Golang?,Slice is a lightweight data structure and supports variable length. It is dynamically sized and flexible. A slice formed with two indices and separated by a colon.
What do you understand by the GoROOT variable in Golang?,"It is used to find standard libraries. In other words, it is a variable used to locate Go SDK. It is always set to the installation directory. We use this variable to determine the root of a workspace."
